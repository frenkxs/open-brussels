'''
This function 'fix_osm' edits the names of street and cities in the osm file. It can edit the encoding of streets and cities
(from unicode to string), and change the cities'/streets' naming convention (eg. from 'Brussel' to 'Bruxelles - Brussel'). 
It takes two compulsory agruments - the source osm file and the type of edit (fix_unicode or fix_address). 
To edit streets and cities, two additional arguments are needed - type of address ('street' or 'city') and
a dictionary of 'fixes' (output of the function 'build_dict').

'''
Dictionary builder - it parses through the xml and builds a dictionary of the different forms of naming a city or a street. 
Cities are streets can be either in Dutch (Brussel), in French (Bruxelles), or in both languages ('Brussel - Bruxelles' or 
'Bruxelles - Brussel'). This dictionary lists all four posibilities for each city found in the xml file (as keys) and assigns 
them one value. 

The value is always bilingual, but the order (Dutch - French or French - Dutch) may differ as it depends what form the 
parser encouters first. Note that the value of the city (attribute 'v') will only be fixed for cities 
for which at least one tag in the source file contains both French and Dutch name. Cities recorded only in French or 
only in Dutch (or indeed sometimes in French and sometimes in Dutch but never in both languages) will remain 
unchanged.    

The function takes two arguments: the source xml file and 'k' attribute either for street ('addr:street') or city ('addr:city'), 
depending on what we want to fix.

Prints out all cities in the dataset, together with how many of them the dataset contains. 
(The function could be also used for streets, but my exploration of smaller samples of the dataset showed that the map 
contains most streets only once only a couple of times. The huge number of streets in the dataset would also make the output 
fairly impractical. I epxplore streets in function 'process_streets' (see below).
